/**
 * Abstract helper class for {@link \Zend\Pdf\BinaryParser\AbstractBinaryParser}
 * that provides the data source for parsing.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses allow for parsing of in-memory, filesystem, and other
 * sources through a common API. These subclasses also take care of error
 * handling and other mundane tasks.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement at minimum {@link __construct()},
 * {@link __destruct()}, {@link readBytes()}, and {@link readAllBytes()}.
 * Subclasses should also override {@link moveToOffset()} and
 * {@link __toString()} as appropriate.
 *
 * The constructor is not defined in this abstract class. However, implementing
 * classes should provide one. It should do the following:
 * - Open the data source for parsing.
 * - Should set $this->_size to the total size in bytes of the data source.
 * - If the data source cannot be opened for any reason (such as insufficient
 *   permissions, missing file, etc.), it should throw an appropriate exception.
 *
 * The destructor is also not defined in this abstract class. However, 
 * implementing classes should define one, and have it close the data source.
